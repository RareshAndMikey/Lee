# Raresh's Open Source Joke Program License
You can do whatever you want to do with the program and it's source code as long as:

* If you modified the code, make it clear what mine, and what's yours
* Don't insert malitious code into it (like making it to set itself to launch on startup)
* Don't insert code that could fuck up someone's computer
* Be honest. Own up if someone asks you if you did the prank.
