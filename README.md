# Lee
Because a system restart doesn't need to be boring.

## What is it?
Lee is joke program that does the following things, in order

1. Plays the troll song
2. Launches `notepad.exe`
3. Types a mysterious message (run it to see it)
4. Restarts the computer via the `shutdown -r -t ?? -f` command

That's it

## Can I make it more malitious?
See the license for that.
