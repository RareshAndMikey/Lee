# Lee
Because a system restart doesn't need to be boring.

## What is it?
Lee is joke program that does the following things, in order

1. Plays the troll song
2. Launches `notepad.exe`
3. Types a mysterious message (run it to see it)
4. Restarts the computer via the `shutdown -r -t ?? -f` command

That's it

## Can I make it more malitious?
See the license for that.

### Credits
This project is based on Michael Whiting's (a friend at school) `lolo.vbs`. The difference is that while his code is long (every key was typed manually), mine takes advantage of `for` loops. And his original version opened up Chrome and looked up the song on YouTube.
